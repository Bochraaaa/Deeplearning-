# Deeplearning-
This is the mobile net architecture that I made some changes:
I used transfer learning to adjust the architecture, for solving the classification of blood vessels problem.
It was fine tuned and I add some layers, note that I change the activation function and th loss function 
with new learning rate and optimizer (hyperparametres).
